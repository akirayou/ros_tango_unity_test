# ros_tango_unity_test

This is Sample code of ROS.NET(https://github.com/uml-robotics/ROS.NET_Unity) and google Tango.


This sample just broadcasts Tango camera's position on Unity.
For more detail, Please see Assets/RosManager.cs

This is for Using ROS in UNITY application.It means you need something beautiful interface. 

If you want to get just Tango information,I recoomend to use "Tango ROS Streamer" http://wiki.ros.org/tango_ros_streamer


If you want  camera image on display and Tango information.(Camera image is useful for mounting and checking tango device).My sample code is useful.(Andorid studio project with java only)

Caution: Google Tango SDK supports only Unity5.6.x
Yes,Tango is over. But useful as robot's SLAM camera.
